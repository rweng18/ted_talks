# Predicting Ted Talk Viewcounts via Topic Modelling
## WORK IN PROGRESS

## Part I: Topic Modeling and Natural Language Processing
Ted Talks can be categorized using hundreds of topics. This project will start by using natural language processing and unsupervised learning to create a smaller set of topics with which to categorize Ted Talks.

## Part II: Recommendation System
Create two recommendation models using TF-IDF and LDA topics to recommend TED talks based on cosine similarity and Jensen-Shannon similarity respectively.

## Part III: Visualization and Interactive Interface
Use Streamlit to develop an interactive interface to view exploratory data analysis and deliverables of project.
