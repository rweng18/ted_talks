### Part I: Topic Modeling and Natural Language Processing
Ted Talks can be categorized using hundreds of topics. In fact, on the TED website itself, a wide range of topics are listed [here]{https://www.ted.com/topics}, from niche topics like "biomimicry" to general ideas like "big problems." This project will start by using natural language processing and unsupervised learning to create a smaller set of topics with which to categorize Ted Talks.

### Part II: Recommendation System (beta)
Next, I created two simple recommendation systems using TF-IDF and the topics modeled above to recommend TED talks based on cosine similarity and Jensen-Shannon similarity respectively.

### Part III: Visualization and Interactive Interface
Finalyl, I used Streamlit to develop an interactive interface to view exploratory data analysis and deliverables of project. One of the major benefits ofo
