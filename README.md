# Predicting Ted Talk Viewcounts via Topic Modelling
## WORK IN PROGRESS

## Part I: Topic Modelling and Natural Language Processing
Ted Talks can be categorized using hundreds of topics. This project will start by using natural language processing and unsupervised learning to create a smaller set of topics with which to categorize Ted Talks.

## Part II: Predicting Viewcounts
Use supervised machine learning to predict viewcounts. Features of the Ted Talk include the topics modelled above, titles, duration, and date since published online.

## Part III: Visualization and Interactive Interface (Pending)
